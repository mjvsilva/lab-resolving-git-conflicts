My name is Maria Jo√£o and I am from Lisbon, Portugal. I have some prior experience coding with C#.

I came to Ironhack looking to change careers. I hope to learn useful skills in the areas of machine learning and data analysis.

I am open to all experiences after the bootcamp ends. My main goal at the moment is stable employment.
